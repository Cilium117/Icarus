Mods for Icarus

In-game effects:

Carbonetik: Removed Swim Speed reduction and replaced with +10% Movement Speed on the Naneo Armor Set. Doubled the Naneo effects for the Composite Armor Set to make it competative with the Naneo Set.

Shengong Bow+: Added +100% Damage to the Shengong Workshop bows. Have only tested with the Zhang Hu bow. Couldn't test with other Shengong Bows as I don't own them. 

Minerjack_ForgedCrops+: Increased Mining Radius for the "Neves" pickaxe (60 -> 75). Increased Felling Damage on the "Dias" Axe (50 -> 70). Increased +Smelting speed of the Talent "Stoking the Flames" (1/2 10% -> 15% & 2/2 15% -> 35%), and the growth speed of the Talent "Green Thumb" (1/2 10% -> 15% & 2/2 20% -> 30%)
